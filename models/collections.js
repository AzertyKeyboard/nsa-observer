It\'s the default interception mechanism of [[NSA]] for both voice, PS2 and USB keyboard keypresses, exfiltered data, network traffic and any kind of data the NSA is interested to extract from a target. It\'s a very advanced attack where a [[Radar]] sends a [[CW]] toward a target covertly equipped with a eavesdropping bug called a [[Retro Reflector]] which will modulate the original [[CW]] signal and re-radiate this modulated [[CW]] so that it can be picked up by the emitting [[Radar]]. The benefit of such technique is that there is no need for the eavesdropping bug to generate radio signal, and therefore, no need for huge batteries or power. It also means that the bug can be turned on and off remotely, providing easy way to turn off the bug when a bug sweep detection team is trying to located it. The downside is that it\'s dangerous for health as the Radar signal between 1Ghz and 6Ghz can be harmful to human and cause illness and cancer, as it did numerous times in the past since the first time it was detected in the US Embassy in Moscow, Russia.http://www.emfacts.com/2012/06/john-goldsmith-on-scientific-misconduct-and-the-lilienfeld-study-an-oldie-but-still-relevant-today/http://www.ehjournal.net/content/11/1/85http://emrstop.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=118:they-have-known-about-microwave-radiation-harm-for-decades&catid=31:emf-politics-a-research-analyses&Itemid=40http://www.scribd.com/doc/13616226/The-Moscow-Embassy-incidenthttp://www.wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1976MOSCOW01437_b.html#efmAtaAwK",relatedItems:[""]});

There is also a [[SIGAD]] of the same name, which is described as a \"key corporate partner\".The FY 2013 budget for STORMBREW is $46.06 million.<ref name=\"WP20130830\">{{cite news|title=NSA paying U.S. companies for access to communications networks|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-paying-us-companies-for-access-to-communications-networks/2013/08/29/5641a4b6-10c2-11e3-bdf6-e4fc677d94a1_story.html|accessdate=31 August 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=30 August 2013|author=Craig Timberg and Barton Gellman}}</ref> STORMBREW consists of the following [[SIGAD]]s:{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"!Designation!Covername!Legal&amp;nbsp;Authority<sup>\'\'See&amp;nbsp;Note\'\'</sup>!Key Targets!Type of Information collected!Remarks|-|US-3140&amp;nbsp;(PDDG:TM)|MADCAPOCELOT|[[Executive Order 12333]]|The country of Russia and European Terrorism <!--should be very specific, Not Russian Counterterrorism, Russia itself -->|DNI and [[metadata]] through [[XKeyscore|XKEYSCORE]], [[Pinwale|PINWALE]] and MARINA||-|US-983&amp;nbsp;(PDDG:FL)|STORMBREW||Global|* \"DNR (Directory ONMR)\"* \"DNI Collection, limited to [[FISA]] and [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008|FAA]], Cyber hit counts on FAA DNI access\"|\"Key corporate partner with access to international cables, routers, and switches\"\"\"|}",relatedItems:[""]});
