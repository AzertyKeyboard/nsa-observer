Items.insert({name:"CW",category:"program",family:"collect",status:"unknown",description:"Continuous Wave aka [[CW]] is a continuous radio signal sent toward a target so that the reflected radio wave is modulated by the signal to intercept. It\'s the default interception mechanism of [[NSA]] for both voice, PS2 and USB keyboard keypresses, exfiltered data, network traffic and any kind of data the NSA is interested to extract from a target. It\'s a very advanced attack where a [[Radar]] sends a [[CW]] toward a target covertly equipped with a eavesdropping bug called a [[Retro Reflector]] which will modulate the original [[CW]] signal and re-radiate this modulated [[CW]] so that it can be picked up by the emitting [[Radar]]. The benefit of such technique is that there is no need for the eavesdropping bug to generate radio signal, and therefore, no need for huge batteries or power. It also means that the bug can be turned on and off remotely, providing easy way to turn off the bug when a bug sweep detection team is trying to located it. The downside is that it\'s dangerous for health as the Radar signal between 1Ghz and 6Ghz can be harmful to human and cause illness and cancer, as it did numerous times in the past since the first time it was detected in the US Embassy in Moscow, Russia.http://www.emfacts.com/2012/06/john-goldsmith-on-scientific-misconduct-and-the-lilienfeld-study-an-oldie-but-still-relevant-today/http://www.ehjournal.net/content/11/1/85http://emrstop.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=118:they-have-known-about-microwave-radiation-harm-for-decades&catid=31:emf-politics-a-research-analyses&Itemid=40http://www.scribd.com/doc/13616226/The-Moscow-Embassy-incidenthttp://www.wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1976MOSCOW01437_b.html#efmAtaAwK",relatedItems:[""],links:[]});
