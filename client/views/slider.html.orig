                                Because we think it's important for citizens to understand what's being released, and why they must act to protect their privacy.

                            <p>
                                Because it's hard to keep track of everything that was leaked. And it gets harder and harder.

                            <p>
                                Because we think collaboration is required for this information to be maintained on the long run.

                            is a "jargon" word used to describe a group
