                                This site will attempt to provide 
                                public informations and links about the NSA programs, 
                                compartiments, and attack vectors.
                            </p> 
                            <h3>What?</h3>
                            <p>
                                Yes, the words "attack vectors" or "compartiments" 
                                feel weird and unusual. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Reading about <i>"intelligence"</i> means going
                                through a lot of jargon. But don't be afraid, 
                                we will try as much as possible to come with 
                                definitions or links helping you to understand.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Why are you doing this?</h3>
                            <p>
                                Because we think it's important for citizens to understand what's being released, and why they must act to protect their privacy.
                                Because it's hard to keep track of everything that was leaked, and it keeps coming.
                                Because we think a collaborative initiative is required for this information to be maintained on the long run.
                                Because we didn't find this vizualisation anywere else.

                                is a "jargon" word used to describe a group

                                groups for higher security. When a compartiment 
                                is compromised, the other ones are still secure
                                as they are kept unaware one from another.
