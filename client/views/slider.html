                        Since the summer of 2013, we are continously gathering 
                        and processing public informations about the NSA global surveillance revelations
                        and now have a collection of {{num}} entries 
                        including programs, attack vectors, or things like
                        compartiments.

                                Don't know what an "attack vector" or a "compartiment" is?

                                Don't worrry, reading about <i>"intelligence"</i> means going
                                through a bit of jargon, and we're here to provide 
                                definitions or links to help.

                                To enter the database, click on links (ex: <a class="item-show-link" category="program" family="collect">Collect</a>).

                                Because we think it's important for citizens to understand what's being released, and why they must act to protect their privacy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Because it's hard to keep track of everything that was leaked, harder and harder as information keeps on coming.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Because we think collaboration is required for this information to be maintained on the long run.

                            <p>
                                Because, well, we didn't find this vizualisation anywhere else and thought "Why not?".
